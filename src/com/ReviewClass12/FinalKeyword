Final keyword:
final is keyword in java that we can use with class field and method
Final keyword with class:
1) when used with class no other class can inherit from that class
2) when used with variables can not change the value of variables
3) when used with methods can't override that method
Why we should make our class final?
when ever we have a very long inheritance relationship or
a very big class or we don want others to inherit and override our
methods
we declare that class as final.
if we do not want anyone else to change/override behaviours of our methods
we declare those methods as final
variables if we don't want to change the values of a variables
we declare them as final for example Gravitational acceleration
or value of Pi
